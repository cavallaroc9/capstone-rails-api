## MyTravel Memories App

MyTravel Memories App allows you to track all of your travel memories in one place. You can add the location, description, start and end dates, and even give your travel memory a star rating so you can record how your trip went. For release 1, users have the ability to add an image address URL to make your travel memory even easier to remember! This app integrates with Google Places API Web Service to make it easy for users to search for a location as well as using that location to auto populate forms.

Once signed in, registered users can:
- Add travel memories
- Update travel memories
- View travel memories
- Delete travel memories
- Change Password

## Planning, Process and Problem-solving strategy

At the start of my project I created user stories for my application. From these user stories I was able to create wireframes for what I wanted the app to look like and to meet the criteria in the user stories.

I started with implementing my backend API using Rails. Once this was complete and tested using curl scripts, I was able to move onto the front-end.

As a starting point for my front-end, I used Brian's Angular Auth template: (https://github.com/BrianLM/angular-auth). This template included an auth service to make calls to allow a user to sign in, sign up, change password, and log out. I was able to create the front-end for auth and hook it up to the auth service.

Once authentication was fully working, I moved on to working on my resource. Brian's template also was an excellant guide for helping me figure out how implement CRUD actions on my resource only if authenticated by passing in certain data.

Once I was able to get GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, and DELETE working for me resource through the client, I moved on to adding additional features and styling to my app.

I was able to find almost all of my answers by searching Google. I was able to find documentation on almost everything I wanted to implement. If I didn't know how to do something, I would search google and find some documentation. I would look through that documentation and if it made enough sense I would start trying it out it my own app. Sometimes I could not follow the documentation exactly depending on what I wanted to do, but most of the time this documentation was a helpful guide.
